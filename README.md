# Docker Web Application

Welcome to our web application project! This README provides information about the project, its setup, and contribution guidelines.

## Installation and Setup

To run the web application locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaack-njama/docker-web-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd docker-web-app
   ```

## Docker Setup

Before running the application using Docker, you need to install Docker on your machine. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

### Installing Docker

#### For Linux Users

Follow the official Docker documentation to install Docker Engine on [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) or [other Linux distributions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

#### For macOS Users

1. Install Docker Desktop for macOS by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

#### For Windows Users

1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

### Running the Application with Docker

Once Docker is installed on your machine, follow these steps to run the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 <image_name>
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Note

We're in the process of containerizing the application. Once the containerization is completed, you'll be able to run the application directly without building the Docker image manually.
